# Homework8
Run Homework8_1.py will show the plot and print out the maximum of the function for problem 1.
Run Homework8_2.py will show the contour plot and print out the value for the minimum found from my gradient descent function.

I had some problems with this homework that I was not able to figure out, and I realize that something is wrong with my gradient descent function.
I do not believe it is working properly. I was also unable to get the scipy fmin function to work.
